We could first handle parantheses. One we get to a paranthesis that doesnt 
 have a pranthesis in it, we can start looking for multiplications or 
 divisions from left to right. When we find a token like this, we can do 
 the calculation and then delete used tokens from vector and put a single 
 vector with the result of the calculation. When we end up with a single 
 value in a paranthesis, we can remove the paranthesis and start working 
 on the outer paranthesis.
