2- return type, name, parameter list, body.

3- main

4- The main function returns int. Returning 0 means a successful execution.
 Returning another number means an unsuccessful execution.

5- Compiler converts human readable source code to machine readable machine code.

6- Adding external libraries to our code.

7- A .h file is a library file that contains things such as function definitions.

8- Linker links together the .obj files generated by all the .cpp and .h files used

9- Source file is human readable text. obj file is machine readable conversion of it.

10- And IDE is an Integrated Development Environment. It has tools such as editor, 
 compiler, linker, debugger. It allows us to develop, run and test our programs.

11- When i was studying programming languages before, i experienced first hand that 
 writing programs after studying the features helps you truly understand it. Because 
 you dont know what you dont know.
